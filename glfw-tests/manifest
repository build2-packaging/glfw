# CI Configuration
#

# Build matrix: all supported configurations.
#
builds: all

# Exclude FreeBSD
#
# At present, FreeBSD is the only unsupported platform in CI. This is due to
# missing dependencies required to build GLFW, namely, Wayland and X11
# libraries. These are not currently available through FreeBSD package
# manager in a form that 'bdep' can consume automatically.
#
builds: -freebsd

# Exclude macOS GCC builds due to lack of Objective-C 2.0 support.
#
# GCC does not support Objective-C 2.0, which is a requirement for building on
# macOS (e.g., when linking against Cocoa APIs).
#
builds: -macos
